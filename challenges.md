# Routing
## On initial page load was able to keep the header with landing page. But as soon as i navigate to other page, i coudn't remove the landing page.
- Need to keep the header with the landing page and when user routes to other page also keep the header.
# Solution

- I used windows.location logic to keep the landing page, otherwise route to outlet
